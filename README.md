# PawCare Bookings

A browser-based pet grooming appointment booking application. Pet owners
select a grooming service, pick an available time slot, and submit their
info to (eventually) create a Google Calendar event, log a booking record
in a Google Sheet, and receive a confirmation email plus a reminder email
the day before the appointment.

Built for MO-IT161 Web Systems and Technology — Milestone 1 (Weeks 2–5).

## Project Status (Milestone 1)

This milestone covers the frontend-only stage of the project:

- **HTML** — semantic structure for all core sections: services, how-it-works,
  booking form, business hours, contact form, footer.
- **CSS** (`style.css`) — layout, typography, reusable component classes
  (`.btn`, `.form-group`, `.service-card`, slot-picker states), and a
  responsive layout.
- **JavaScript** (`script.js`) — interactive features:
  - Service selection sync between the Services section and the booking form
  - A generated Time Slot List with simulated availability per date, filtered
    by service duration and the 15-minute sanitation buffer
  - Booking form validation (including custom checks for pet size and time
    slot selection) and a dynamic request preview
  - A live character counter on the Contact form's message field
  - Frontend-only contact form feedback after valid submission

**Not yet implemented** (planned for later milestones): Google Calendar
event creation, Google Sheet booking log, confirmation/reminder emails, and
dynamic service data loaded from a Sheet. The current Time Slot List uses a
simulated availability formula in the browser, not a real Calendar read —
this is called out in code comments in `script.js`.

## Viewing the Website

Visitors can open the deployed website at:

**https://jcspades21.github.io/pawcare-bookings/**

To enable or check GitHub Pages, open the repository's **Settings > Pages**
menu and configure it to deploy from the `main` branch and the `/ (root)`
folder. Leave the **Custom domain** field empty unless you own a separate
domain name. The GitHub Pages URL above is a project URL, not a custom domain.

## Running Locally

No build step is required. Clone the repository, then serve the folder with a
local static server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcspades21/pawcare-bookings.git
cd pawcare-bookings
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** in a browser. Opening `index.html` directly
also works, but a local server is more reliable for loading assets.

## Workflow Documentation

Implementation decisions, priorities, and progress tracking for this
project are documented in the team's **Browser-Based Application
Development Workflow Worksheet** (Google Sheet), updated weekly alongside
this repository.

## Milestone 1 Review Status

The current frontend demonstrates the required HTML structure, responsive CSS
presentation, and JavaScript interactions for service selection, date and time
slot selection, booking validation, request preview, contact feedback, and
character counting. The interface clearly labels booking and contact feedback
as frontend-only behavior until the backend is implemented.

Before submission, the team should update the Browser-Based Application
Development Workflow Worksheet with the final repository URL, Weeks 2–5
progress, implemented interactions, dependencies, scope decisions, discussion
notes, reflection, and team contributions. The worksheet is external to this
repository and is not represented by a local file.
